## My Comments on Given Code:
The code looks good and I enjoyed reading it, especially the use of repository pattern. I have less seen of it projects. but I believe it should be used more often. Need to cleaner and ehance
readablity

### Refactoring
Although I skimmed through the code and added refactoring as much as possible I may have missed some points. In any case following are my thoughts on refactoring in the given code.

* I have use camelCase for variable name it is recommend in php latest version
* Remove extra and un-used code
* Create some private function that is ehance code cleanes.
* Align public function and private function. 
* Ensure functions return consistent formats for better maintainability.
* Fix logical errors in functions, handle failures properly.
* Validate and sanitize inputs to maintain data integrity.
* Stick to consistent PHP variable naming conventions.
* Prefer Eloquent or query builder over DB::table for queries.
* Use function-based helpers instead of class-based static helpers.
* Explicitly declare access types for functions.
* Choose one array syntax (array() or []) and be consistent.
* Always use curly braces with conditional statements to avoid ambiguity.

#Overall Impression

The code exhibits a well-structured design, particularly with the implementation of the repository pattern, which is a commendable practice.
The readability is above average, but there's room for further improvement.
Refactoring Suggestions

While i've already addressed some aspects, here are additional recommendations:

Variable Naming:
    Adhere to consistent naming conventions, preferably camelCase as recommended in the latest PHP versions.
    Use descriptive and meaningful names that convey the purpose of variables.

Code Optimization:
    Eliminate any redundant or unused code segments.
    Encapsulate repetitive logic within private functions to enhance code cleanliness and maintainability.

Function Structure:
    Group related functions together for better organization.
    Ensure consistent indentation and spacing for improved readability.
    Declare access types (public, private) explicitly for clarity.

Output Consistency:
    Establish a uniform format for function return values to streamline maintainability.
    Handle errors gracefully, providing informative messages for debugging.

Input Validation and Sanitization:
    Implement robust input validation to safeguard against invalid or malicious data.
    Sanitize user input to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.

Database Interactions:
    If applicable, consider leveraging Eloquent or the query builder for database interactions as they offer a more expressive 
    and maintainable approach compared to DB::table.

Helper Functions:
    Favor function-based helpers over class-based static helpers for cleaner code structure.

Code Style:
    Maintain a consistent syntax for array declarations (either array() or []).
    Always enclose conditional statements (if/else) within curly braces to avoid unintended behavior.

Additional:
    Break down complex functions into smaller, more manageable units.
    Utilize meaningful comments to explain non-obvious code sections.
    Write unit tests to verify code functionality and catch regressions during refactoring.
